Project Overview:
Our project aims to develop a fully functional e-commerce website using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This e-commerce website will provide users with a seamless shopping experience, allowing them to browse through various products, add items to their cart, and complete their purchases securely.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Users will be able to sign up, log in, and log out securely. Authentication ensures that each user has a personalized shopping experience and access to their order history.

Product Catalog: The website will feature a comprehensive catalog of products, organized into categories and subcategories for easy navigation. Each product will have details such as name, description, price, and images.

Product Search and Filtering: Users can search for products using keywords and apply filters to narrow down their search results based on categories, price ranges, brands, and other attributes.

Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart, view the contents of their cart, update quantities, and remove items as needed. The cart will display the total price, including taxes and shipping charges.

Checkout Process: The checkout process will guide users through the steps required to complete their purchase, including entering shipping and billing information, selecting payment methods, and reviewing their order summary before finalizing the transaction.

Order Management: Users will have access to their order history, including details of past purchases, order status, and tracking information. They can also manage their shipping addresses and payment methods.

Responsive Design: The website will be designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
